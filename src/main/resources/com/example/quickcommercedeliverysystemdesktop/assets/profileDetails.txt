This directory stores user profile images.

To add a default avatar image:
1. Create or download a default avatar image (240x240px recommended)
2. Save it as "default-avatar.png" in the assets folder
   (D:\Quick-Commerce-Delivery-System-Desktop\src\main\resources\com\example\quickcommercedeliverysystemdesktop\assets\)

User uploaded profile images will be stored in this "profiles" subdirectory.

The ProfileController will handle:
- Copying user-selected images to this directory
- Saving the file path to the database
- Loading and displaying profile images
